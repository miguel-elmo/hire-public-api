# Requisitions
Creating a requisition is the first step in the recruitment process as they form the foundation of all recruitment activities for a job. A requisition must first exist before Job Ads can be posted, and all job applications received are tracked within the Requisition.

# Job Ad
Multiple Job Ads can be posted per Requisition, and each can have individual settings and details. E.g. different location, description, dates, etc.

# Job Application
Job Applications are created within the Requisition when candidates apply to a Job Ad. Job Applications can also be created directly in the Requisition by an ELMO user. (edited)
