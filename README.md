# Requisitions
Is the foundation of all job recruitment process.
We start by having a requisition before we are able to create Job Ad and Job Application into our system.

# Job Ad
We can create multiple Job Ad under the same Requisition with different description, dates, etc.

# Job Application
We can create Job Application directly to the Requisition or User or Candidates can apply through Job Ads.
